                    Arizona boasts a rich history that dates back over 11,000 years. From the Native American tribes
                    that inhabited the area to the Spanish explorers that arrived in the 16th century, Sedona has a
                    colorful past.

                    In the late 1800s, settlers began to arrive and establish homesteads, which led to the growth of the
                    town. <strong>Today, Sedona is a popular tourist destination that attracts visitors from around the
                        world with its natural beauty and spiritual energies.</strong>

                    at one of the many spas.
